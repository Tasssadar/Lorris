You will need QtFramework 4.7 to build Lorris (4.6 _should_ be also ok, but it is not tested).<br>
Built binaries should be in bin/debug or bin/release.
<h4>Building on Windows</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
    Download Lorris, open Lorris.pro in QtCreator and hit "Build" button. 
</p>
<h4>Building on Linux</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
    You need libqwt-dev to build Lorris on Linux, at least version 6.0.0. If it is in your distribution's repository, just install it.
    If it is not, there are libqwt.so* and libqwtmathml.so* in dep/qwt/lib. Copy these files to your distro's lib directory, eg. /usr/lib.
    These are for 64bit only however.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
    <b>For 32bit users:</b> go to dep/qextserialport folder and execute these commands to rebuild QExtSerialPort for 32bit:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 60px">
    qmake qextserialport.pro
    make clean
    make
</pre>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
    Now you can build Lorris with QtCreator or go to Lorris folder and execute these commands:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 30px">
    qmake Lorris.pro
    make
</pre>
